var question = [];
var correctAnswer = [];
var wrongAnswer = {
/*correctAnswer.index0: [wronga1, wronga2, wronga3]
			... .indexm: [wrongn1, wrongn2, wrongn3]*/
};
var correctGuess = function() {

};
var wrongGuess = function() {

};
var timeUp = function(){

};

//Step 2: Create click events which allow users to select and input guesses. Maybe you'll want a Submit button, but not required.
//You will need to create classes or IDs to assign to these click events.
$("img").on("click", function charSelect()) {

};
$("img").on("click", function charSelect()) {

};

/*Step 3: Create functions which cause users' guesses to change the screens. Change from question screen to Correct or Wrong screen.
Make sure to change result screen over to next question.*/

/*Step 4: Create timer which runs during each question running.
